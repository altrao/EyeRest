# Eye Rest Timer

This is a simple desktop application designed to remind you to take breaks from your computer screen to rest your eyes. It's based on the 20-20-20 rule (every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds) but allows you to customize the work and rest times.

## Features
*   **Full-Screen Break Reminder:** When it's time for a break, a full-screen window appears to encourage you to step away from your screen.
*   **System Tray Integration:** The application will minimize to the system tray, allowing it to run in the background.
* **Stay on top:** The main app window will remain on top of your applications, making it easy to see.

## How to Use
1.  **Set Work and Rest Times:** In the main window, enter your desired work time (in minutes) and rest time (in seconds) in the provided input fields.
2.  **Start the Timer:** Click the "Start Timer" button. The main window will minimize to the tray, and the countdown will start.
3. **Taking a Break** when the work timer is finished, a fullscreen window will appear, prompting you to take your rest.
4.  **Stop the Timer:** To stop the timer, you can either:
    *   Click the "Stop Timer" button in the main window.
    *   Right-click the system tray icon and select "Stop Timer."
